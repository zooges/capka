# The container starts as root SOLELY to repair the ownership of the bind-mounted
# workspace, then drops to the unprivileged sandbox user for everything else.
#
# Why this is needed: /workspace and /shared are bind-mounted from a host
# directory. Docker resolves that source on the daemon host, and when the host
# created it (or when Docker auto-creates a missing bind source) it is owned by
# root — so a process running as uid 1000 gets EACCES on the very first write
# ("mkdir: cannot create directory '/workspace/...': Permission denied"). Fixing
# ownership here, inside the container at startup, is robust no matter how the
# host produced the mount. We then setpriv-drop to uid 1000; the controller also
# pins every `docker exec` to 1000:1000, so no agent code ever runs as root.

# Return traffic arrives via INPUT (untouched), so no conntrack is needed —
# keeps it working under gVisor's limited netfilter.
