// plugin/embed execution; `base-uri 'self'` blocks <base>-tag injection from
// re-pointing relative URLs; `form-action 'self'` stops a form from being
// hijacked to POST credentials cross-origin. A strict `script-src`/`style-src`
// (no 'unsafe-inline') is intentionally NOT here — it needs a per-request nonce
// threaded through middleware for the inline theme-init script AND Next's own
