/**
 * Per-provider knobs that surface the model's reasoning ("thinking") in the
 * stream. WITHOUT these the provider reasons silently — or not at all — so the
 * SDK never emits `reasoning-delta` and the UI's thinking block stays empty.
 * Returns undefined for providers with no standard knob (e.g. Ollama).
 *
 * Applied optimistically: a model that can't reason rejects the request and the
 * runner retries once without this (see isReasoningUnsupportedError), so turning
 * it on "always" never breaks non-reasoning models like gpt-4o / claude-3.5.
 *
 * Visibility caveat: OpenAI only returns a reasoning *summary* over the
 * Responses API ("openai" provider). Through an OpenAI-compatible gateway
 * ("litellm", Chat Completions) the summary is visible only if the upstream
 * model echoes `reasoning_content` (Anthropic/DeepSeek do; OpenAI hides it).
 *
 * Tunable via `REASONING_EFFORT`:
 *   off|disabled|none — disable thinking where the wire format supports it
 *   low|medium|high|max|… — pass through (provider-specific)
 * DeepSeek V4 maps low/medium → high server-side; only `thinking:{type:"disabled"}`
 * actually speeds short replies, so DeepSeek defaults to off when unset.
