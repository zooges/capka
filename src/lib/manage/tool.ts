// `z.any()`, `.passthrough()`, `looseObject` — to `additionalProperties: false`,
// which forbids the model from sending a single `args` key (repo/content/path,
// name/url, …) and makes every collection `add` impossible. The raw `jsonSchema`
// helper passes through `asSchema` verbatim, so leaving `args.additionalProperties`
// absent keeps it OPEN. Runtime field-shape validation isn't lost: `toInput` maps
// the envelope and each collection's `addSchema`/control `schema` validates the
// payload in `dispatch` with a better (usage-echoing) error than the SDK's generic
// one. (See the tool-schema regression test, and mcp/adapt.ts for the same escape hatch.)

const DESCRIPTION = `Manage the user's own preferences, platform-wide configuration (admins), AND connectors (MCP) — all through chat.

Permission is decided by the SERVER from each action's result — not by you reading a role/scope. Everything list/capabilities returns is already available to THIS user, so never refuse up front, never say "you're only a regular user / ask an admin", and never quote internal keys (org.*) to the user. To do something, just call the action and react to the result; only an error result (forbidden/not_found/apply_failed) means it can't happen.

Settings/controls:
- action="list" (or "capabilities") discovers what THIS user may manage. Never invent an id.
- action="get" reads a control; action="set" changes it (value is always a string).
- Risky/platform-wide changes are approved by the USER, not you — this is handled automatically. When you call such a "set", the tool call PAUSES: the user sees an Approve/Reject card and the app blocks until they decide. You don't stage or re-send anything. If they approve, the tool then runs and returns the applied result — continue naturally from there (e.g. confirm it's done). If they reject, you'll get a denial result — acknowledge it and move on. NEVER tell the user to "press Confirm / click the button" (the card speaks for itself), never say you lack permission, and never re-call "set" to retry a pending approval. Undo is a button on the applied card, not something you trigger.

Collections (target="mcp" for connectors, target="skill" for agent skills, target="automations" for scheduled agent runs):
- action="get" with a collection target lists its items AND returns that collection's \`usage\` — the exact add args and workflows. Get the collection BEFORE your first add/edit to it (an add with wrong args also returns the usage). add/remove/enable/disable/debug/connect operate on items (itemId identifies one).
- Each collection in a list/get result carries a resolved \`canAdd\` boolean — that, and ONLY that, tells you whether you may add there; trust it over any inference (e.g. a toggle like "members can install connectors" governs OTHER end-users, never you-as-caller).
- add/remove AND enable PAUSE for the user's approval exactly like a risky setting (enabling a connector/skill/automation activates third-party code or unattended spend, so it needs the same click); after they approve, the action runs and returns its result, and if they reject you get a denial — you never apply it yourself. disable/debug/connect run directly.
- status="action_required" carries a URL only the USER can open (e.g. an OAuth sign-in) — DON'T open it yourself; tell the user to use the button/link, then re-check with action="debug".

Permission and info are different things. Permission is server-side — just attempt the action; never infer what YOU can do from a setting's value (a toggle like "members can install connectors" restricts other end-users, not you-as-caller). If you're only missing INPUT to act — most often a connector's url (remote) or command (local) — ask the user for exactly that in one plain question, and never dress a missing url up as a permissions/admin problem.`;
